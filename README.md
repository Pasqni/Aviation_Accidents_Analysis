# Aviation Accidents Analysis

## Project Description
This project was intended to conduct a comprehensive analysis of all airplane accidents that have occurred from 1919 to 2023. The dataset provided includes nearly 25,000 incidents with detailed information about each event.

## Objective
The primary goal was to analyze the dataset to uncover valuable insights and trends related to airplane disasters over the last century. This involved creating visualizations and answering critical questions to enhance the understanding of aviation safety and potentially inform future safety measures.

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following information for each incident:

- Date: The date of the incident.
- Type: The type of aircraft involved.
- Registration: The aircraft's registration code.
- Operator: The operator of the aircraft.
- Fatalities: The number of deaths resulting from the incident.
- Location: The location where the incident occurred.
- Country: The country where the incident occurred.
- Category (cat): The category of the incident as described by the ASN.

## Analysis and Findings
### Key Insights
The analysis provided answers to several important questions:

- **Which Country Has the Most Incidents?**: By aggregating the data by country, we identified the nations with the highest number of airplane accidents.
- **Incident Frequency by Day of the Week**: An analysis was conducted to determine if accidents occur more frequently on certain days of the week.
- **Safest Operators**: We evaluated the data to identify which operators have the lowest number of incidents and fatalities, highlighting the safest operators.
- **Aircraft Type with the Most Fatalities**: The data was analyzed to find which types of aircraft have been involved in the most fatal incidents.
- **Post-9/11 Incident Trends**: We examined how the frequency and nature of incidents have changed since September 11, 2001.

### Additional Insights
Further analysis was performed to answer other relevant questions, providing a deeper understanding of the data and uncovering additional trends and patterns.

### Visualizations
Various visualizations were created to represent the findings, including:

- **Bar Charts**: Showing the number of incidents by country, day of the week, and operator.
- **Line Charts**: Illustrating the trend of incidents over time, particularly before and after significant events like 9/11.
- **Cartogram**: A cartogram was created to visually represent the number of incidents per nation, providing a geographic perspective on the data.

## Tools and Techniques
The analysis leveraged various data processing and visualization tools, including Python libraries such as `Pandas` for data manipulation, `Matplotlib` for plotting graphs, and `GeoPandas` for creating the cartogram.

## Summary
This Big Data project successfully analyzed a comprehensive dataset of airplane accidents spanning over a century. The insights and visualizations generated from this analysis contribute to a better understanding of aviation safety trends and can inform future efforts to enhance air travel safety. The detailed exploration of the data highlights key areas for improvement and helps identify patterns that could lead to more effective safety measures.
